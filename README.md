# Classification-with-Decision-Tree
Classification using Decision Tree Classifier
## Objective:
The objective of this project is to predict iPhone purchases based on age, gender and salary using the Decision Tree Classifier.
## Methodology:
The primary purpose of this project is to predict whether an individual will purchase an iPhone based on several factors such as age and salary. The dataset consists of 380 observations and 3 key variables: Age, Salary, and Purchase of iPhone (the target variable). Given that the target variable is categorical (binary: 0 or 1), a classification model is appropriate for this task. A Decision Tree Classifier model has been implemented to predict iPhone purchases based on the input features. The model was developed using the Python programming language within the Jupyter Notebook IDE.
## Software:
1. Python
2. 2. Jupyter Notebook
